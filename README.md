# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software engineering is the systemic application of enginering principles, methods and tools to develop high quality software.
- It is important in that it enables one to create the systems and software that power various aspects of day- day life like communication, mobile banking...etc

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- Development of agile methodologies like scrum that allow for continuous and timely yet high quality software delivery
- Creation of programming languages like C and Python that create the base for applications used today
- Software engineering becoming a discipline

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- They include requirements collection (Gathering information about the problem set the software should solve, the users..etc), \n design (Coming up with a sketch work of sorts that dictate how the system will be created to achieve the requirements),implementation (writing and coding out the software to transform idea into application), testing ( running the application through sample scenarios of the problem set to test relevance to requirements), deployment ( making the software accessible to end users), and maintenance ( Continuously monitoring performance to ensure optimal performance)  


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- The waterfall method involves going one step at a time and only proceeding to the next once the previous is completed. If a flaw is identified, the process is repeated
- The agile methodology however involves iterating over each step such that if a flaw is identified, it can be fixed there and then without repeating the entire process
- Waterfall methodology would be helpful in a recipe program as one can't skip to step 7 without going through step 1-6. Agile methodology would be helpful in a program such as a data cleaning software which if a  better method to clean data is found, it is simply embedded onto the existing solution

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- A software developer is responsible for the creation and maintenance of a software such that it achieves optimal performance while solving the problem set. The Quality assurance engineer is responsible for ensuring the software created adheres to the quality standards desired by both the end users and general software standards. The project manager is responsible for overseeing the software development from its creation to quality checks to deployment and maintenance.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- IDEs provide a user friendly code environment that makes it easier for the developer to create the programs whereas a VCS system allows for the developers to maintain stable versions of the system while allowing for test scenarios to test and deploy new features. It also works as a version history of the software

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Burnout. For this, one simply needs to rest and find inspiration
- Project delays. The solution here is to properly collect requirements and plan as well as track progress of the software development to ensure issues are addressed early 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit testing refers to testing specific sections of a software. For example testing Word on the Microsoft Office Suite. This allows us to have a detailed analysis of each component
- Integration testing is testing for a software's usability across multiple systems like andrioid and IOS. This allows the system to be cross platform independent
- System testing involves an overall software test to see if it is functioning as intended. This ensures the system overall is a good system for use
- Acceptance testing involves checking whether the system created adheres to the problem set defined. This ensures the client requirements are being addressed

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- Prompt engineering is the process of creating suitable queries with relevant information and keywords to allow AI systems to generate optimal results.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- Vague prompt: Who was the president?
- Specific prompt: In the year 1985, who was the elected and serving president in the country Kenya?
- Making a promt concise allows for shorter processing time as well as more relevant results to desired output
